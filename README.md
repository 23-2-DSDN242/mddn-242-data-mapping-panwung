## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images shown here are various pens masked out of their backgrounds and, with the masks, two different ink bleed effects are applied to the two polar regions; areas painted black have a shorter, greyscaled body and tail, whereas white regions have full colour with each ink dot (this colour is based on where it starts on the original image and can either carry this colour or take on a different one as it moves down). 

The pen is a common household utensil. Its simple function and unceasing usage makes it one of the most important objects ever invented. Through ink and in language of forms and letter forms, bears the basic necessities for visual or literary expression. There was a brief point in my life where I wanted to be a writer. I would spend hours at a time wasting away at paper and pen, only to ultimately, if not inevitably, return to null. The ink, though wasted, left perminant imprints upon the paper via the pressure of pen against the paper, and by imperfections at the pen's tip, caused by excessive use, which allowed for some trails of ink to stain and disperse.

The masks soley highlighted the pens. Though there are background images, they are all subjected to the lesser hierarchical, secondary greyscale filter. This is to have the inky quality applied to every aspect of the frame, while still maintaining all focus on the subject. The colours - the ink - dripping downward from the pen is fully coloured, displacing its hues and values to wherever it travels below. While it would make much more sense to have it bleed at the pen(s) tip as opposed to the entire pen (let alone the entire scene), I felt that the effect being applied wholly would yield far more interesting results.
